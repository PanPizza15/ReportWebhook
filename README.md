## 🔍 What is ReportWebhook?

ReportWebhook is a lightweight plugin for Minecraft servers using Paper, Spigot, or Bukkit. It allows players to report others by typing a simple command `/report`. When a report is made, it sends a clean and easy-to-read message to a Discord channel using webhooks. This helps server admins keep track of players who may be breaking the rules.

The plugin is built to be safe, without showing exact player locations, and works smoothly on modern Minecraft servers, especially version 1.21 and above.

## 🎯 Key Benefits

- **Easy Player Reports:** Players only need to type `/report` followed by the name and reason.  
- **Discord Integration:** Reports appear instantly in your chosen Discord server as neat message cards (called embeds).  
- **Privacy Safe:** Does not share coordinates to protect player locations.  
- **Fast and Reliable:** Runs without slowing down your server by working asynchronously (in the background).  
- **Updated for Modern Servers:** Made for Minecraft Paper servers 1.21 and later.
